            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Jarett Forzano. I am from Newtown CT and have a passion for coding and working with others.</p>
            <p>I have been coding since High School and am thankful that I have gotten the opportunity to major in a program that can allow me to leave my mark on the world.</p>

            <h3>Background Information</h3>
            <p>I first started coding small python projects which led to my interest in Discord bots. After creating a discord bot that was able to impact those within my community I started to look for more ways to expand my skill set.
                I then discovered Linux, Linux has had one of the largest impacts on me by far. Thanks to linux I have had the opportunity to learn a lot about the inner workings of my computer and have been able to touch base on a lot of cool software that I never knew existed before.
            </p>
            <p>During my first year of learning, I found out that learning a coding language is no easy task. Even so when most tutorials make it hard for you to use what you have learned in other projects. When I discovered this, I gained a passion for making reproducible code that is well documented and easy to read. This has also led me to use NixOS and their package manager for my linux setup because of the awesome reproducibility that it comes with.</p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>

            <p>I have lost over 30 pounds of weight from working out and so fitness has become a large part of my life. Due to that I also climb a lot as it's a great chance to have fun and exercise. I also cook which helps me make balanced and nutritious meals and allows me to enjoy a variety of meals.</p>

            <p>When I was a freshman in high school I discovered Boy Scouts and set a goal to achieve Eagle Scout. I had to earn 21 merit badges and complete a community service project where I made benches for my local church. I went around to local businesses and required donations for my project. By the time I was a senior in high school, I completed my goal and got Eagle Scout.
